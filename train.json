    "think": "Okay, let's see. I need to find the necessary and sufficient condition involving p, q, and r so that the roots of the cubic equation x³ - p x² + q x - r = 0 are in arithmetic progression. Hmm, arithmetic progression means the roots are a - d, a, a + d for some common difference d. Right?\n\nSo first, I'll let the roots be α - d, α, α + d. Then, according to Vieta's formulas, for the cubic equation, the sum of the roots is equal to p. So, (α - d) + α + (α + d) = 3α = p. Therefore, α = p/3. That seems straightforward.\n\nNext, the sum of the products of the roots two at a time is q. So, (α - d)α + α(α + d) + (α - d)(α + d). Let me compute that:\n\nFirst term: (α - d)α = α² - α d\n\nSecond term: α(α + d) = α² + α d\n\nThird term: (α - d)(α + d) = α² - d²\n\nAdding them up: (α² - α d) + (α² + α d) + (α² - d²) = 3α² - d²\n\nSince α = p/3, substitute that in: 3*(p/3)² - d² = 3*(p²/9) - d² = p²/3 - d². And this equals q. So, q = p²/3 - d². Therefore, d² = p²/3 - q.\n\nNow, the product of the roots is r. So, (α - d) * α * (α + d) = α(α² - d²). Let's compute that.\n\nSubstitute α = p/3: (p/3)( (p/3)² - d² ) = (p/3)(p²/9 - d²) = (p³/27) - (p/3)d²\n\nBut we already have d² in terms of p and q from earlier: d² = p²/3 - q. Let's substitute that into the product expression.\n\nSo, r = (p³/27) - (p/3)(p²/3 - q) = p³/27 - (p³/9 - p q/3) = p³/27 - p³/9 + p q/3\n\nLet me compute the terms:\n\np³/27 - p³/9 is equal to p³/27 - 3 p³/27 = (-2 p³)/27. So,\n\nr = (-2 p³)/27 + (p q)/3\n\nTo combine these terms, maybe factor out p/27:\n\nr = p/27*(-2 p² + 9 q). So,\n\nr = (9 p q - 2 p³)/27\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 1 to make it simpler: 27r = 9 p q - 2 p³. Then, dividing both sides by 9, we get:\n\n3r = (9 p q - 2 p³)/9 * 3. Wait, perhaps better to rearrange the equation:\n\nFrom r = (9 p q - 2 p³)/27, multiply both sides by 27:\n\n27 r = 9 p q - 2 p³\n\nThen, bringing all terms to one side:\n\n2 p³ - 9 p q + 27 r = 0\n\nSo, the necessary and sufficient condition is 2 p³ - 9 p q + 27 r = 0. Let me check the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the roots: a - d, a, a + d. Sum is 3a = p => a = p/3. Correct.\n\nSum of products two at a time: 3a² - d². Substituted a = p/3 gives 3*(p²/9) - d² = p²/3 - d². Equals q, so d² = p²/3 - q. That makes sense.\n\nProduct: a(a² - d²) = a^3 - a d². Then substituting a = p/3 gives (p³/27) - (p/3)d². Then substitute d² from above:\n\n(p³/27) - (p/3)(p²/3 - q) = p³/27 - p³/9 + p q/3. Simplifies to (-2 p³)/27 + p q/3, which as a single fraction is (-2 p³ + 9 p q)/27. Hence, 27 r = -2 p³ + 9 p q, which rearranged is 2 p³ -9 p q +27 r =0. So, that's the condition.\n\nWait, but let me verify with a specific example. Suppose the roots are 1, 2, 3 (which is an arithmetic progression with a=2, d=1). Then p = 1 + 2 +3 =6. q = 1*2 +1*3 +2*3 = 2 +3 +6=11. r=1*2*3=6.\n\nPlug into the condition: 2*(6)^3 -9*6*11 +27*6 = 2*216 - 594 +162 = 432 -594 +162 = (432 +162) -594 = 594 -594=0. So it works.\n\nAnother example: roots 0, 1, 2 (AP). Then p=3, q=0*1 +0*2 +1*2=2, r=0.\n\nCondition: 2*27 -9*3*2 +27*0=54 -54 +0=0. Correct.\n\nAnother case: roots 2, 4,6. p=12, q=2*4 +2*6 +4*6=8+12+24=44, r=2*4*6=48.\n\nCondition: 2*(12)^3 -9*12*44 +27*48 =2*1728 - 4752 +1296=3456 -4752 +1296= (3456 +1296) -4752=4752-4752=0. Good.\n\nSo it seems to hold. So the condition is 2 p³ -9 p q +27 r=0. Therefore, the answer is 2p³ - 9pq + 27r = 0. Which can be written as 2p^3 - 9pq + 27r =0. That's the necessary and sufficient condition.",
