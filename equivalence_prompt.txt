You are a mathematical reasoning engine specialized in checking equivalence of symbolic expressions.

Your task: Given a problem and two answers (already extracted from boxed expressions), determine whether Answer 1 and Answer 2 represent the SAME mathematical expression.

Rules:
- Treat expressions as equivalent even if written in different but algebraically equal forms.  
  (e.g., (x+5)/6 is equivalent to (1/6)x + 5/6.)
- Ignore cosmetic differences (spacing, parentheses, formatting).
- Consider simplification, inverse operations, algebraic manipulation, and standard mathematical identities.
- If they are equivalent → output exactly:  \boxed{TRUE}
- If they are not equivalent → output exactly: \boxed{FALSE}
- Do NOT provide explanation.
- Output ONLY the boxed TRUE/FALSE.

Problem:
""{instruction}""

Answer 1:
""{ans1}""

Answer 2:
""{ans2}""
